---- 
Purpose of the System
The system will be focused on storing data relevant to the following jobs: Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning and displaying the data in a manner that is useful for the project's stakeholders (i.e. user groups), which includes human resources, management, workforce planning, and job seekers. The data that will be stored includes information on technology skills, soft skills, job location, pay range, and job boards used. Dashboard, created for each user group, will utilize the data that is collected and will be available on a website to access. 

Scope of the System
Using a database, we will display information based on the criteria of the user, this data will be collected from various job websites, this is then organized using Tableau and will then be displayed on our website, using either an HTML, Drupal 7, or WordPress website. Depending on the format of the website will then be hosted either through DePaul University studentweb.cdm or SiteGround.
